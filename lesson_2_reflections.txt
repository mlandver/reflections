\f0\b\fs30 \cf2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?\
The Working the directory is the most recent version of all your files. It is what you are currently working on. From there you put files into the staging area. Once you have decided exactly what files you want to commit, you commit the staging area and it goes into the repository. I think it allows the user to plan what files he would like to commit before he actually commits them.\
